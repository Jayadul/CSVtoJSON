Hi Jayadul,



As discussed:



+ project conditions:
+ this is a test task.
+ you have 10 hours to do your best. Try to focus on the essential parts and leave the details.
+ you are also paid for researching.
+ all the hours must be logged using the Upwork logger.
+ try to apply the best practices to the project.
+ you will be paid for your work and not for the results.
+ projects requirements:
+ must be in .net 6, c#10, console app
+ operations:
+ input parameters:
1. mapping.json (please see an attached example file, only assume its schema and not the values).
2. test.csv (please see attached example file).
+ read the content of CSV (you cannot map to a data class, I can use several CSV structures).
+ using the mapping.json file, you convert the information coming from CSV into JSON.
+ you show the generated JSON in the terminal and save it on the name of the CSV file provided with the extension .json.
+ the validationClass and transformationClass should be implemented in the project.
+ testing:
+ I expect at least one xUnit test (all the code we write in the company has tests).



Test case:
+ the CSV file has seven records with five fields.
+ the mapping.json file has three fields described.
+ the expected result is:
+ [ { "num": 1, "description": "My_name_is_1!", "years": 19 }, { "num": 2, "description": "", "years": 24 }, { "num": 3, "description": "My_name_i1", "years": 29 } ]



Note: if the validation fails for one of the fields, the record is discarded.



I hope you can pass the test.
If yes, there are more exciting things to develop.



Please invite me to the GitHub repo you will create for this task: miguel.goncalves.v@gmail.com.

Miguel Goncalves
